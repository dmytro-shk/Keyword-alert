# Keyword Alert Chrome Extension

Get instant notifications when specific keywords appear on websites. Perfect for service dispatchers, support teams, and anyone who needs to track important information across multiple web pages.

## Real-World Use Case: Service Dispatch Operations

This extension was originally designed to help dispatchers manage high-volume operations efficiently.

**The Challenge**: You're a service dispatcher managing 1000+ customer accounts. Each account has unique requirements and special instructions that you need to remember before creating service tickets.

**The Solution**: Set up keyword alerts for each account:

- **Main Trigger**: "service request" OR "ticket creation" (detects when you're about to create a ticket)
- **Secondary Trigger**: "ABC Company" (detects when you're working on this specific account)
- **Alert Message**: "⚠️ REMINDER: ABC Company requires 24-hour advance appointment scheduling. Check customer availability before confirming visit."

Now, whenever you're creating a ticket for ABC Company, you'll automatically get a reminder about their special requirements - no more missed appointments or unhappy customers!
